# Back to the Futurama

**Project by:** Ooha Reddy, Natalie Aramendia, and Soumya Lahoti  
**Course:** COMPDSGN 490  

## Overview

*Back to the Futurama* reimagines the 1939 Futurama Exhibit at the New York World’s Fair, where the public rejected the vision of a car-dependent future. Instead, they feared its consequences, such as air pollution, traffic fatalities, and urban sprawl. This project offers a multi-user, interactive spatial audio experience where participants explore a virtual soundscape in a public plaza, immersed in anti-car propaganda.

## Story

The original Futurama Exhibit, sponsored by General Motors, presented a vision of America’s future dominated by cars and superhighways. While this vision helped boost the automobile industry, many initially feared cars, and early protests against them were common. In this reimagined narrative, the public rejected the Futurama vision as harmful. Instead of embracing a car-centric society, they saw it as a step toward environmental destruction and social decay, leading to a world that rejects cars and promotes alternative futures.

## Design Idea

This project features a **multi-user, interactive spatial audio experience** set in a virtual public plaza. Participants explore the environment by moving through the classroom, listening to sounds that depict a world where the dangers of cars are amplified. Audio includes **conversations**, **news reports**, **social movements**, and **music**—all reinforcing the narrative of rejecting car dependence.

## Core Technical Features

### 3D Spatial Audio
- **Augmented 3D sound** overlaid on reality, calibrated to the classroom.
- **Dynamic sound behavior** that adjusts based on user proximity to audio sources in the virtual space.

### Audio Content
- Various conversations, news reports, social movements, and music, all centered around anti-car sentiment and the dangers of car-centric living.

### Physical Interaction
- Users explore the soundscape by moving within the classroom, with audio transmitted directly to their mobile devices.
- **VPS Tracking**: User movement is tracked via VPS mapped to a point cloud mesh, enabling precise location-based interactions.

### Web-Based Accessibility
- Deployed using **Zappar** and  **Immersal** for **WebAR** for easy accessibility.

## Track Breakdown

- **Computer Science:**  
  - Web hosting and VPS-based movement tracking.
  
- **Social Policy:**  
  - Historical narrative creation and media generation focused on anti-car sentiment.
  
- **Digital Media:**  
  - Design of the interactive soundscape and deployment via WebAR.
